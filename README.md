# SQL Queries
Welcome to my SQL queries repository!
## Instructions
1) To query the databases, open one of the folders and download the ".sqlite" file. This is the database. You can either open this in a terminal/command line running sqlite3 or in a Desktop browser such as DB Browser for SQLite. Download the ".sql" file. These are the query prompts.
2) You now have two options. Go to step 3 and skip step 4 if you are running sqlite3 in a terminal/command line. Skip step 3 if you are using DB Browser.
3) Open the ".sql" file in a text editor. These are the queries. You can either copy and paste these queries into the terminal, then run them one by one, or you can run the file as a script.
4) Open the ".sql" file in DB Browser with the database already loaded. You can choose to run step-by-step here.
5) Please get in touch if you have any further "queries". ;)

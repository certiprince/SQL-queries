# SQL Queries
Welcome to my SQL queries repository!
## Instructions
1) To query the databases, open one of the folders and download the ".sqlite" file. This is the database. You can either open this in a terminal/command line running sqlite3 or in a Desktop browser such as DB Browser for SQLite.
2) You now have two options. Choose A if you are running sqlite3 in a terminal/command line and B if you are using DB Browser.
  
  A) Open the ".sql" file in a text editor, or view the raw code on Github. These are the queries. You can either copy and paste these queries into the terminal, then run them one by one, or you can run the file as a script.
  
  B) Open the ".sql" file in DB Browser with the database already loaded. You can choose to run step-by-step here.
3) Please get in touch if you have any further "queries". ;)
